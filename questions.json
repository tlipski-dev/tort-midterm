      "A. Yes, a duty always exists to help anyone in danger",
      "B. No, unless a special relationship or exception applies",
      "C. Yes, but only if the victim requests help",
      "D. No, because negligence law does not recognize duties"
    ],

    "explanation": "At common law, there is no general duty to rescue. Exceptions exist when the defendant created the peril, undertakes a rescue, or stands in a special relationship."
